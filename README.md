# Microsoft-face-api-integration-through-python

Build facial recognition software into your applications with the Face API from Microsoft Azure. Detect, identify and verify faces with this powerful API. I will try to integrate these APIs through python. For this, I will create a small face dataset of all the characters of our favorite sitcom F.R.I.E.N.D.S. I will use this dataset to identify whether the image provided by me belongs to which character. The same logic can be used for creating projects like Attendance management, visitor management, access control etc with facial recognition.

## Microsoft face apis are powerfull, but will I my bet my life savings on them? NO. Theses are things to keep in mind while using these APIs for product development.
